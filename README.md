Weather App Assignment

## Description

Here is a short description about my thoughts looking into this project.

<strong>What was your motivation?</strong>
<br>
    -The main motivator when completing this assignment was the constant voice in the back of my mind telling to me that I can accomplish this new challenge.
<br>
<strong>Why did you build this project?</strong>
<br>
    -This project was my first attempt at utilizing my knowledge of JavaScript and see how it worked cohesively with the WEB API methods. A great introduction to the subject.
<strong>What problems did I encounter?</strong>
<br>
    -There were two problems at the end that I encountered. The first being the program still ran even though the user did not put a valid input. The second was that the previous password text was still displayed on the screen and would not refresh when starting a new generated password and would combine the two. With the help of my tutor, I was able to figure out that my variable to store the password was global and not local. So every time the function was ran, the memory was still stored and not reset. The while loop was the solution to the program still running after an invalid input. The prompt kept displaying even after an invalid input with an alert to notify the user to choose a valid number. 
<br>
<strong>What did you learn?</strong>
<br>
    -I learned a lot more about if else statements, how loops are very important to get an answer you want without having to write an unnecessary amount of code, and the importance of global and local scopes.
