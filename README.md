Weather App Assignment

## Description

Here is a short description about my thoughts looking into this project.

<strong>What was your motivation?</strong>
<br>
    -The main motivator when completing this assignment was the constant voice in the back of my mind telling to me that I can accomplish this new challenge.
<br>
<strong>Why did you build this project?</strong>
<br>
    -This project was my biggest attempt at utilizing my knowledge of JavaScript, Web API's, and localStorage and seeing how it worked cohesively. An extremely challenging assignment covering all the subjects.
<strong>What problems did I encounter?</strong>
<br>
    -All of the acceptance criteria I encountered a problem to a certain degree. Main problems included displaying the data and the local storage. My first problem was mostly resolved through my tutor. I found out the solution to my local storage problem through an activity in week 4 sprint. 
<br>
<strong>What did you learn?</strong>
<br>
    -I learned a lot more about Web API's and local storage. Being able to draw information from these API's was a big stepping stone with my general understanding of this subject.
